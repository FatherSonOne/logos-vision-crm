# Look at my project in F:\logos-vision-crm thoroughly.  It is a CRM for managing Non Profits as Clients and Project Management.  Research other major CRM's and determine what features are most important and also what features are not present in most CRM's today.  Create a Plan to implement these new features into my current project.  Please look at what has already been built and understand the structure of Logos Vision.  After a few attempts at enhancing the project we got caught up on bugs and fixes and I lost sight of the plan we had in place.  Please note that some of the changes have left the overall UI and Style of Logos Vision feeling off theme and patchy.  Can we please keep the styling consistent throughout all improvements.  Form your responses in the form of step by step instructions for Me to input using Claude Code and VS Code.  Pause between steps and whenever an action is needed.  With all of that in mind, Let's create a plan and get started.

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary for you:

## 💡 KEY FINDINGS FROM MY RESEARCH

### Most Critical Missing Features (in order of importance)

1. **Household Management** - Group family members
2. **Pledge vs Donation Tracking** - Separate commitments from received gifts
3. **Outcome Measurement** - Document impact and client progress
4. **Donor Engagement Scoring** - Identify high-value and at-risk donors
5. **Automated Acknowledgments** - Thank-you emails and tax receipts

### Your Competitive Advantages

- AI-powered grant writing (competitors don't have this)
- AI project planning (competitors don't have this)
- Advanced project management - Kanban, Gantt, Timeline, Flowcharts (exceeds competitors)
- Modern glassmorphism design (more polished than competitors)
- Integrated team collaboration


### Why Start With Design System (Phase 1)

- Fixes the "patchy" appearance issue
- Ensures all new features look professional
- Establishes reusable patterns
- Speeds up future development
- 2 weeks to transform overall appearance
