## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### "Component won't load"
→ Check phase doc's Technical Details section
→ Verify data types match TypeScript
→ Look for console errors

### "Data not saving"
→ Check Supabase connection
→ Verify RLS policies allow writes
→ Check table schema matches
→ Look at network tab for failed requests

### "Integration not working"
→ Verify API keys are correct
→ Check authentication tokens
→ Look at sync logs for errors
→ Test connection manually

### "Performance is slow"
→ Add database indexes
→ Implement pagination
→ Reduce re-renders
→ Check query complexity
