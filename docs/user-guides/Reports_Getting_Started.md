## Key Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you get the most out of the Reports system.

### Reports

A **report** is a structured view of your data, often with visualizations. Reports can be:
- **Tabular**: Data displayed in rows and columns
- **Visual**: Charts, graphs, and other visualizations
- **Mixed**: Combining tables and charts
- **Interactive**: Allowing filtering and drill-down

### Dashboards

A **dashboard** is a collection of widgets (reports, KPIs, charts) arranged on a single screen. Think of it as your personalized control panel for monitoring key metrics at a glance.

### Data Sources

The foundation of every report is a **data source**:
- **Contacts**: People in your CRM
- **Organizations**: Companies and groups
- **Opportunities**: Sales pipeline and deals
- **Tasks**: Activities and to-dos
- **Interactions**: Emails, calls, meetings
- **Custom Objects**: Your organization's custom data

### Visualizations

**Visualizations** transform data into graphics:
- **Table**: Traditional rows and columns
- **Bar Chart**: Compare values across categories
- **Line Chart**: Show trends over time
- **Pie/Donut Chart**: Display proportions
- **Scatter Plot**: Reveal correlations
- **Heat Map**: Visualize patterns in matrices
- **Funnel Chart**: Track conversion processes
- **Gauge**: Display single metric progress
- **Number**: Show key statistics
- **Map**: Geographic data visualization

### Filters

**Filters** limit the data shown in your report:
- **Simple Filters**: Quick filtering by common fields
- **Advanced Filters**: Complex logic with AND/OR conditions
- **Date Range Filters**: Relative (last 30 days) or absolute dates
- **Saved Filters**: Reusable filter templates

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

**KPIs** are metrics that matter to your business:
- Track specific numerical goals
- Compare actual vs. target values
- Monitor trends over time
- Receive alerts on threshold breaches
