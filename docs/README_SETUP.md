# Logos Vision CRM - Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

Your project folder is now created at:
`C:\Users\Aegis{FM}\OneDrive\Documents\logos-vision-crm`

### Files Created:
- ✅ package.json (project dependencies)
- ✅ tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
- ✅ vite.config.ts (build tool configuration)
- ✅ .gitignore (files to ignore in version control)
- ✅ .env.local (environment variables - needs your API key)
- ✅ index.html (main HTML file)
- ✅ index.tsx (app entry point)
- ✅ types.ts (TypeScript type definitions)

### Folders Created:
- ✅ src/ (main source code folder)
- ✅ src/components/ (React components)
- ✅ src/data/ (mock data and database)
- ✅ src/services/ (API services)
- ✅ src/utils/ (utility functions)
- ✅ src/components/ui/ (UI components)

## ⚠️ What's Missing

Your uploaded files didn't include all the component files. We need:
- All React component files (.tsx files)
- The complete src/data folder with mock data
- The complete src/services folder
- The main App.tsx file (I can see it, but need to copy it)
- src/types.ts file with all type definitions

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Upload Complete Source Code**
   - Do you have access to the full project in Google Drive or AI Studio?
   - Can you download the complete folder and share it?

2. **Or I Can Create Them**
   - I can create all the missing files based on what I see in App.tsx
   - This will take some time but will get you a complete working app

Which would you prefer?
